## Hey there üê¨
### My name is **Sima** and this is my first time coding, I am taking class because the course seemed cool when I read about it. I am very intrested in learning all about coding and improving all of my skills. I have recently taken a robotics class so I have some idea of basic coding and what I am doing, yet there is still so much I want to learn.
### [Here is a link of my last robotics project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gfWwSqtNetqFYWXZF32nCUpfigkFU7Zi/view?usp=sharing)
